## Task 5 – Question 3: Implementation Checklist

All required implementation steps for this project have been fully completed in the Jupyter Notebook.

### Completed Components

- **Complete preprocessing**
  - Loading all datasets
  - Handling missing values
  - Removing orders with fewer than two items
  - Sampling transactions
  - Constructing shopping baskets
  - One-hot encoding of baskets

- **Apriori execution**
  - Running the Apriori algorithm with different minimum support values
  - Extracting frequent itemsets
  - Analyzing itemset size and frequency

- **Association rule generation**
  - Generating association rules using lift as the main evaluation metric
  - Computing support, confidence, and lift
  - Filtering rules to one-to-one associations

- **Finding the best rules**
  - Ranking rules based on lift
  - Selecting the strongest rules
  - Interpreting the results for business applications

### Conclusion

The Jupyter Notebook provides a complete, reproducible, and well-documented implementation of the entire association rule mining process, satisfying all requirements of Question 3.
